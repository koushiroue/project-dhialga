    <h1>Prologue</h1>

    <p>
      The door opened up creakingly. Two shadowly figures accompanying a boy into the large room. There were three mysterious figures sitting on throne who seems to be the ones in charge of this weird place. Suddenly, one of them speaks. "Damon Marcellus, You are guilty". The boy was scared and followed up with a confused face. "What!? I did nothing wrong! I'm innocent!" The boy had flashbacks about the time before he got accused guilty. "Damon! I fucking told you to clean the attic. Better do it right now before your bed sleeps with the flames!" Damon panicked and quickly ran upstairs. "Alright Alright! I'll do it. Just don't burn my comfy bed please".</p>
    <p>Damon opened the dusty attic door that comes with a ladder. Using the feather duster, he cleaned up the place lazily and stacked the boxes. Something caught in his eye as he moved the boxes. He pulled out something from a box. It was wrapped in tattered cloth. For some reason it took him awhile to tear it off. Finally, it was uncovered. An old pocket watch with a weird design. "Sheesh, why did I even want to check it in the first place. What a junk". Filled with boredom, he swung the pocket watch like a yo-yo. Back and forth. Suddenly, he heard his sister from downstairs. "Damon! I fucking told you to clean the attic. Better do it right now before your bed sleeps with the flames!" "Wait what? I'm sure she heard me before and I'm doing it right now" He felt weird. As he tried to check downstairs he saw himself panicking and passed through him.</p>
    <p>"Huh. I probably knocked myself with the pocket watch. What a weird dream I'm having." The dream piques his interest and he followed himself going to the attic. He felt really weird about his dream and everything was the exact same thing happened. "Wew, I must be this bored if I get today's activities as my dream". He noticed he was still holding the pocket watch. "Good thing I still have this to kill some time till I wake up". He swung the pocket watch frontwards. As he swung it, everything looks faster. "Wait a fucking minute. This isn't some bizarre dream I'm having isn't it"</p>
    <p>"How the fuck do I go back? I can't even touch myself or anything" He started to look closely at the pocket watch. There were some symbols on the knob that he could not comprehend. "Where did my father even get this watch. There's no way this is from the greek age because the symbols aren't similar at all". He tried to push the knob and cracking noise were heard. Suddenly, everything around him was in cracks. Shattered into pieces, he looked at his phone to check the time. "11:29AM. Looks like I'm back to the current time. This is truly an unusual pocket watch my father had". With a sinister smile on his face, he quickly calls his best friend, Altair Stella. "Hey man, I got a pretty watch that I want to show. Meet me later"</p>

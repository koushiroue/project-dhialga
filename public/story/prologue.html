    <h1>Prologue</h1>

    <p>The door opened up creakingly. Two shadowly figures accompanying a boy into the large room. There were three mysterious figures sitting on throne who seems to be the ones in charge of this weird place. Suddenly, one of them speaks. "Damon Marcellus, You are guilty". The boy was scared and followed up with a confused face. "What!? I did nothing wrong! I'm innocent!" The boy had flashbacks about the time before he got accused guilty. "Damon! I fucking told you to clean the attic. Better do it right now before your bed sleeps with the flames!" Damon panicked and quickly ran upstairs. "Alright Alright! I'll do it. Just don't burn my comfy bed please".</p>
    <p>Damon opened the dusty attic door that comes with a ladder. Using the feather duster, he cleaned up the place lazily and stacked the boxes. Something caught in his eye as he moved the boxes. He pulled out something from a box. It was wrapped in tattered cloth. For some reason it took him awhile to tear it off. Finally, it was uncovered. An old pocket watch with a weird design. "Sheesh, why did I even want to check it in the first place. What a junk". Filled with boredom, he swung the pocket watch like a yo-yo. Back and forth. Suddenly, he heard his sister from downstairs. "Damon! I fucking told you to clean the attic. Better do it right now before your bed sleeps with the flames!" "Wait what? I'm sure she heard me before and I'm doing it right now" He felt weird. As he tried to check downstairs he saw himself panicking and passed through him.</p>
    <p>"Huh. I probably knocked myself with the pocket watch. What a weird dream I'm having." The dream piques his interest and he followed himself going to the attic. He felt really weird about his dream and everything was the exact same thing happened. "Wew, I must be this bored if I get today's activities as my dream". He noticed he was still holding the pocket watch. "Good thing I still have this to kill some time till I wake up". He swung the pocket watch frontwards. As he swung it, everything looks faster. "Wait a fucking minute. This isn't some bizarre dream I'm having isn't it"</p>
    <p>"How the fuck do I go back? I can't even touch myself or anything" He started to look closely at the pocket watch. There were some symbols on the knob that he could not comprehend. "Where did my father even get this watch. There's no way this is from the greek civilization because the symbols aren't similar at all". He tried to push the knob and cracking noise were heard. Suddenly, everything around him was in cracks. Shattered into pieces, he looked at his phone to check the time. "11:29AM. Looks like I'm back to the current time. This is truly an unusual pocket watch my father had". With a sinister smile on his face, he quickly calls his best friend, Altair Stella. "Bro meet me up at the usual place"</p>
    <p>"Altair Stella. Such a girlish name yet he doesn't think it was girlish as his parents told him it's just a cute boy name. I felt like his parents actually wanted a daughter instead of a son. What a messed up thing but that's just how life is". These thoughts were coming up to my mind while I was walking to the usual place which was in an abandoned warehouse. Although the building was supposed to be demolished years ago. But there was certain reasons that made the demolition got called off. There was something unexplainable that's like protecting the building but I have a feeling that the pocket watch have some relation to it.</p>
    <p>As Damon and Altair meets up at the abandoned warehouse.
      <br>
    <div class="indented">
      <br>"Bro, I got a new fancy watch"
      <br> "Damon please that's lame"
      <br>"You sure?"
    </div>
      <br>
      <br>
      Damon swungs his pocket watch backwards and turned back time and said the same thing but he knows what Altair would say after that.
      <br>
    <div class="indented">
      <br>"Bro, I got a new fancy watch and your next line will be---- 'Damon please that's lame'"
      <br>"Damon please th-"
    </div>
      <br>
      <br>
       Altair stopped before he could finish his sentence. He was shocked that Damon knew what he was going to say. With a puzzled face, he asked.
       <br>
     <div class="indented">
       <br>"How did you know that I was going to say that?"
       <br> "Hehe~ The truth is I can see the future"
       <br> "Pffft, that's impossible you can't do that"
     </div>
       <br>
       <br>  With sheer confident, he pulls out a smug on his face.
       <br>
      <div class="indented">
       <br>"I can repeat everything you're going to say next"
     </div>
       <br>
       <br> Damon repeats the same thing he did to Altair a while ago for few more times.
       <br>
       <div class="indented">
       <br>"Unbelievable but how!?"
       <br>"This pocket watch is the key to the stuff I did. It lets me to turn back time by swinging it backwards. I found this at my house in the attic while cleaning up the place but I don't even know if I can even show you how it happens"
       <br> "What if I hold your hand or anywhere on your body while you swing it"
       <br>"Uhh let's try then".
       </div>
       <br>
       <br>
       Altair holds his hand while Damon swings the pocket watch backwards.
       
    <p>Turns out it actually worked. Time did gone backwards for both of them. Altair was amazed by this phenomenon.
      <br>
      <div class="indented">
      <br>"But doesn't this mess up the flow of the time?"
      <br> "I don't know but what the fuck do I care I can do this everyday"
      <br> "I don't know man this can really mess up something up like random unexplainable beings come up to you and rape your ass for messing up the flow of time"
      <br> "Nah... don't sweat it. It's fine" 
      </div>

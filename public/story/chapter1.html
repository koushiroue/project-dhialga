    <h1>Chapter 1</h1>

    <p> <div class="indented">
    "What a fucking day" "Travelled back to the past and found myself getting pranked by my younger self" "Not just that, I got slapped around this and there until somehow I got into this mess"  
    </div>
    <br>Damon sighed at his situation while walking into the unknown space. 
    <br>
    <div class="indented">
    <br>"Hell-" "Wait which bastard would say hello when he's going into some unknown place" 
    </div>
    <br>Damon facepalmed while he walks forward into the dark abyss of unknown. Then, he realizes someone or something was following him. He looks back and saw a creature that he could not comprehend at all. It's appearance would be like the sky became a monster and gave itself some ruby eyes. As Damon takes a few steps backwards, he realized he was already surrounded by the unknown creatures. 
    <br>
    <div class="indented">
    <br>"Shit Altair was right I'm gonna get raped by these creatures" 
    </div>
    <br>Trying to find a weapon, he finds himself the pocket watch inside his pocket which he used to go back in time. 
    <div class="indented">
    <br>"Oh right I could just do turn back time from the start. What a fucking idiot I am"
    </div>
    <br>Damon quickly swung the pocket watch backwards. He kept doing it with a smug until he realized it's not working. 
    <br>
    <div class="indented">
    <br>"Oh no" "Please not like this" "Why are you not working this time"
    
    <br>
    <br>
